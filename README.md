### Hi there <img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/MartinHeinz/MartinHeinz/master/wave.gif" width="30px">, I am Namrata Karmakar!

![Twitter Follow](https://img.shields.io/twitter/follow/knamrata23?style=social)

An Electronics & Telecommunications Engineer by qualification, specializing in Back-end Web Development. My career progression has been a little different than most. I started my career with Cognizant Technology Solutions as a Programmer Analyst Trainee where I was trained in .NET and SQL. 

After Cognizant, I worked in an Insurance Company as an Underwriter where I worked simultaneously in 3 different departments. After my stint at the Insurance Company, I moved on to the Banking Sector where I worked for 2.5 years. 

However, my first love has always been Technology. I had even opted for Computer Science in my High School where I learned Basic OOP concepts and C++ for 2 years. Around the time the pandemic hit, I finally decided to take the plunge and get started with Web Development. After a lot of days working an essential services  full-time job during a pandemic and studying, I took up Web Development full-time in February of this year. 

I have been sharing my progress on Twitter using the #100DaysOfCode. Do check it out [here](https://twitter.com/knamrata23).

- ðŸ”­ Iâ€™m currently working on rewriting the front-end of a To-Do List Application using Angular. I've already built the back-end using Node.js, Express and TypeScript. You can find the repo [here](https://github.com/namrata-karmakar/todo-ts-tdd). I have also built the [front-end](https://github.com/namrata-karmakar/todo-vanilla-ui) for the same app using vanilla JS.
- ðŸŒ± I'm currently learning Angular and MySQL. I plan on learning NestJS, GraphQL and PostgreSQL in coming months. 
- ðŸ’¼ I'm looking for my first Web Development position. If you liked my profile, do think about recommending me to any job openings. Tech Stack is as mentioned in the toolbox below. 
- ðŸ“š I'm currently reading Head First Object-Oriented Analysis & Design by Brett McLaughlin to get a better understanding of how to write great software everytime by following OOAD principles. I've recently read Clean Code by Uncle Bob Martin and found it to be really insightful. Once I'm done with HFOOAD, I plan on starting Head First Design Patterns.
