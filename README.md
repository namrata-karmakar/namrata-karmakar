### Hi there <img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/MartinHeinz/MartinHeinz/master/wave.gif" width="30px"> I am Namrata Karmakar!

![Twitter Follow](https://img.shields.io/twitter/follow/knamrata23?style=social)

I started coding in C++ in school and was hooked after I saw my first Hello world program print on the turbo c++ console. But life happens and my career took me in a different direction. I landed up in banking.

However, my first love has always been Technology. I had even opted for Computer Science in my High School where I learned Basic OOP concepts and C++ for 2 years. Around the time the pandemic hit, I finally decided to take the plunge and get started with Web Development. After a lot of days working a full-time essential services job during a pandemic and studying, I took up Web Development full-time in February of 2021. 

I have shared my progress on Twitter using the #100DaysOfCode. Do check it out [here](https://twitter.com/knamrata23).

- ðŸ”­ Iâ€™m currently pursuing my masters degree in Applied Computer Science from Heidelberg, Germany.

- ðŸŒ± I use Angular and NestJS at my workplace for software development. I also use PowerBI, Azure Data Factory and SQL for data-related activities.

- ðŸ“š A book that has had a lot of impact on my software development journey is Clean Code by Uncle Bob Martin. I found it to be really insightful.
