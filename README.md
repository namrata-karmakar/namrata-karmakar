### Hi there <img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/MartinHeinz/MartinHeinz/master/wave.gif" width="30px"> I am Namrata Karmakar!

![Twitter Follow](https://img.shields.io/twitter/follow/knamrata23?style=social)

An Electronics & Telecommunications Engineer by qualification, Full-Stack Software Developer by profession. My career progression has been a little different than most. I started my career with Cognizant Technology Solutions as a Programmer Analyst Trainee where I was trained in C#, .NET and SQL. 

After Cognizant, I worked for an Insurance Company as an Underwriter where I worked simultaneously in 3 different departments. After my stint at the Insurance Company, I moved on to the Banking Sector where I worked for 2.5 years. 

However, my first love has always been Technology. I had even opted for Computer Science in my High School where I learned Basic OOP concepts and C++ for 2 years. Around the time the pandemic hit, I finally decided to take the plunge and get started with Web Development. After a lot of days working a full-time essential services job during a pandemic and studying, I took up Web Development full-time in February of last year. 

I have been sharing my progress on Twitter using the #100DaysOfCode. Do check it out [here](https://twitter.com/knamrata23).

- ðŸ”­ Iâ€™m currently working on rewriting the front-end of a To-Do List Application using Angular. I've already built the back-end using Node.js, Express and TypeScript. You can find the repo [here](https://github.com/namrata-karmakar/todo-ts-tdd). I have also built the [front-end](https://github.com/namrata-karmakar/todo-vanilla-ui) for the same app using vanilla JS.

- ðŸŒ± I'm currently using Angular and NestJS at my workplace. I plan on learning GraphQL and PostgreSQL in the coming months. 

- ðŸ’¼ I'm currently working as a Programmer Analyst at IrisLogic Inc. I'm not open to new positions, however, I'm always open to chat about any opportunities. You may approach me via Twitter.

- ðŸ“š I'm currently reading Head First Object-Oriented Analysis & Design by Brett McLaughlin to get a better understanding of how to write great software everytime by following OOAD principles. I've recently read Clean Code by Uncle Bob Martin and found it to be really insightful. Once I'm done with HFOOAD, I plan on starting Head First Design Patterns.
